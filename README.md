# Customer Purchase Analysis
## Objective
* The goal of this exercise is to analyze customer purchasing behavior using Pandas for data processing and visualization.

# Part 1: Understanding the Data
1. Load the dataset customer_purchases.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Display the first five rows of the dataset.
3. Check for missing or invalid values and clean the data if necessary.
4. Generate summary statistics for numerical columns using .describe().
# Part 2: Data Visualization
### Demographic Insights
1. Create a bar chart to show the distribution of customers by gender.
2. Create a histogram to display the age distribution of customers.
### Spending Patterns
1. Generate a boxplot to compare spending across different genders.
2. Create a bar chart to visualize the average spending per region.
3. Plot a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between total spending and number of purchases.
### Product Categories
1. Use a count plot to show the most popular product categories.
2. Create a bar chart to display the average spending for each product category.
# Part 3: Insights & Analysis
### Answer the following questions based on your analysis:

* Which age group has the highest average spending?
* Are there significant differences in purchasing behavior between men and women?
* What is the relationship between total spending and the number of purchases?
* Which product category has the highest average spending?
* How does spending vary across different regions?
# Additional Challenge
1. Use a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
2. Categorize customers into low spenders, average spenders, and high spenders and analyze their purchasing behavior.
